#Project Overview

Development of a chatbot & analytics web page using Agent.

Tech Stacks

1. Frontend:

Before POC: Python’s Streamlit library.

After POC: JavaScript.

2. Backend:

Developed using Python.

Deployed using FastAPI.

3. LangChain:

Framework used for LLM.

Logical Flow

1. User Interaction:

User selects a project name and software (e.g., Autodesk) and writes a query related to the software.

2. Backend Request:

A POST request is made to the backend based on the user’s query.

3. ReAct Agent:

Used for selecting the appropriate function call. Requires three components: LLM, Available Tools or Functions, and Prompt.

4. Query Interpretation:

The Agent interprets the query, decides which action to execute (function to call), and determines the parameters to pass (Action input). The output is displayed on the frontend in the form of analytics. Users can further query the analytics, with responses generated by the backend.

5. Pandas Agent:

Used for responding to analytics-related queries.

Deployment

Built docker images for both frontend and backend and defined in docker compose.yml.

Use of Github Actions to push the image to registry.

On every push, a new tag is generated.The tag needs to be updated in workspace for the application to be live.
